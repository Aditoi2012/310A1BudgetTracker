## High level design
The aim of the Budget Tracker project is to create a personal finance web application to enhance userâ€™s financial awareness and to promote healthy financial spending habits. By providing a set of user-friendly and intuitive tools, users will be able to seamlessly track their expenses, set personalised budgets, and visualise their spending patterns, empowering them to make informed financial decisions and work towards their financial goals.
## Project roadmap

This project consists of 3 development stages, each with different scope of work

#### Stage 1 focus:
- Setting budgets/savings goals
- Categorising and tracking of expenses
- Spending overflow notification
- Visualisation of spending/ spending reports

#### Stage 2 focus:
- Forecast/extrapolate different spending and expenses inputs into future
- Customizability of spending reports
- Allow users to export their expenses data and their reports for easier record keeping

#### Stage 3 focus:
- Collaborative Budgeting: Implement a feature that enables multiple users (e.g., families or project teams) to collaborate on a shared budget and track expenses collectively.
- Different user roles with different permissions
- payment service integration and bill splitting (Potential*)
